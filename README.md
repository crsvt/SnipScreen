## Installation (For Windows, Mac, & Linux)

Since this extension is not available on the Chrome Web Store, you need to load it manually in "Developer mode." The process is simple and the same for all operating systems.

#### Prerequisites
*   You must have **Google Chrome** installed.

#### Steps

1.  **Download the Extension Files**
    *   Click the green `<> Code` button on the GitHub repository page.
    *   Select **Download ZIP**.
    *   Find the downloaded ZIP file (e.g., `crsvt-snipscreen-main.zip`) and **unzip it**. You should now have a folder named `crsvt-snipscreen-main` or similar.

2.  **Open Chrome Extensions Page**
    *   Open Google Chrome.
    *   Navigate to `chrome://extensions` by typing it into your address bar and pressing **Enter**.

3.  **Enable Developer Mode**

4.  **Load the Extension**
    *   With Developer mode enabled, you will see three new buttons appear. Click on **Load unpacked**.
    *   An "Open folder" dialog will appear. Navigate to the folder you unzipped in Step 1.
    *   Select the **entire `crsvt-snipscreen` folder** (the one that directly contains `manifest.json` and `background.js`) and click **Select Folder**.

5.  **Confirm Installation**
    *   The SnipScreen extension will now appear in your list of extensions.

6.  **Pin for Easy Access (Recommended)**
